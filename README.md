# Sudden Turns

![Screenshot](Screenshot.png "Sudden Turns")

## Description

A clone of one of my favorite childhood games. Up to four players battle on a single keyboard, aiming to be the last one standing. Each player leaves a trail behind them â€” crashing into any trail, including your own, means elimination!

## Controls

Everything is controlled with the keyboard  

**ESC**: Leave running match or quit game if in home screen  
**UP** ARROW: Remove player  
**DOWN** ARROW: Add player  
**SPACE**: Start game or start next round  

Steering keys for left and right are listed on the home screen.
